# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I made this prework study guide beacuse it will help me succed in the duration of this class! I used HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, Devlopment and ReadME to comeplete this project! I used becoming succesful as motivation and thats really why i built this also cause i see myself creating alot of extradonory websites! This website will help me solve bugs and anything I am stuck on. I learned that when you try and learn something, even though it's the ground/basic, you just have to put your mind to it and you'll succeed.

## Usage

This prework study guide was actually a great idea to start of with because we learn how to use HTML by using the doctype, head, body, and footer. We also learn how to style our HTML with CSS so that we can make it a litle creative and then JavaScript to make it interactive so it's not boring, then we also use Git to bring all together to help us save everything to Github so we dont lose anything from our Prework-Study-Gudie so that I can look at it anytime I need to if I have any easy questions that I dont need the tutors to answer!
